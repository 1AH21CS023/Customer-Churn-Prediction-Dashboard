I’m excited to share my latest project completed as part of my Data Science and Analytics course.
I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides clear and actionable business insights using real customer data trends.

This dashboard highlights:
🔹 Interactive Dashboard & Insights
🔹 Real-time customer retention and churn analysis
🔹 Sales visualization using heatmaps, bar charts, and line graphs
🔹 Customer segmentation insights for targeted marketing

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data modeling, visualization, and business analytics while transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
